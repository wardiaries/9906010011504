					<h2>2. Matches</h2>
					<p><h5>2.1</h5> IGN and Squad Tag Policy  
Elimination Round: Teams are allowed to use ONE different in-game name (IGNs), as long as THREE members share the same clan/squad tag.  

<h5>Allowed configurations per team size:</h5>  
4-member team: 1 player/s with different IGNs, 3 players with the same clan/squad tag. üëâ Register your team here: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/SSE-TEAM-PLAYER-REG" target="_blank">tinyurl.com/SSE-TEAM-PLAYER-REG</a>  
5-member team: Same requirement as above. üëâ Register your team here: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/SSE-TEAM-PLAYER-REG" target="_blank">tinyurl.com/SSE-TEAM-PLAYER-REG</a>  
Teams composed of only 1 or 2 players are still eligible to compete and earn points during the elimination/group stage only.  
IMPORTANT: Any player using a different IGN must be declared before the start of the Group Stage. Failure to do so will result in automatic forfeiture of the affected match scores.  
Semi-Finals and Final Round: Teams must follow this format: 1 different IGN is allowed, while the other 3 players must use the same IGN or squad/clan tag. Only players who were registered/played during the Elimination Round are allowed to participate. No additional players (especially those without matching clan/squad tags) will be allowed to join at this stage. This rule is implemented to promote team identity and consistency in the advanced stages of the competition.  
Additional Notes: While clan/squad tags are not strictly enforced during eliminations, we encourage all teams to follow a ‚Äúsame clan, same tag‚Äù setup for consistency and professionalism. Rules on IGN and tag usage may be adapted based on the specific esports title and event structure, ensuring fairness for all competitors.</p>

<p>During preliminary registration, the budget projection is conservative to cover all potential expenses. Once running, the budget becomes actual-based, adjusting according to final collected funds and actual expenses.</p>
